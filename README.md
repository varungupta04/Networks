## Overview

Understanding computer networks is essential in today's interconnected world. This repository aims to provide practical implementations of fundamental networking concepts, helping you grasp theoretical concepts through hands-on coding.

## Implemented Concepts

- **Socket Programming**: Implementations of basic client-server communication using sockets in various programming languages.
- **Packet Sniffing**: Examples demonstrating how to capture and analyze network traffic to understand protocols and data exchange.
- **Routing Algorithms**: Implementations of routing algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm, Bellman-Ford, etc., for understanding how routers make decisions.
- **Network Protocols**: Simple implementations of network protocols like TCP, UDP, HTTP, etc., to understand their functioning at a code level.
- **Network Security**: Basic examples illustrating network security concepts like encryption, decryption, hashing, etc.
- **Network Simulation**: Scripts to simulate network scenarios, latency, packet loss, etc., using tools like NS-3 or custom scripts.

## Getting Started

To get started with the implementations, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/varungupta04/Networks.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the specific implementation you're interested in**:

    ```bash
    cd computer-network-implementations/<implementation-folder>
    ```

3. **Follow the instructions provided in the README of each implementation**.

4. **Experiment and modify the code** to understand the concepts better or adapt them to your specific needs.
